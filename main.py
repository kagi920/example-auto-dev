I need write permissions to create the login screen files. The implementation would include:

1. **index.html** - Basic HTML structure with login form (username/password fields)
2. **style.css** - CSS styling for a clean, responsive login interface  
3. **script.js** - JavaScript for basic form validation and submission handling

The login screen would be in Japanese as indicated by the issue title and include standard login functionality with proper form validation.
